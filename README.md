# Python, Data Science & Machine Learning Integrated - Hybrid Project

## Overview

This repository contains the project completed as part of the "Python, Data Science & Machine Learning Integrated - Hybrid" summer course. The course covered a comprehensive curriculum, integrating Python programming with essential data science techniques and machine learning models.

## Project Details

### Project Title: Mall Customer Segmentation

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to [insert your projectâ€™s main goal, e.g., "analyze and predict trends in a dataset using various data science and machine learning techniques"].

### Features and Functionalities

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: The project starts with data collection from [mention the source, e.g., "Kaggle dataset, CSV files, etc."]. The data is then cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the data better. This includes:
  - Summary statistics
  - Data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn
  - Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations within the data

- **Data Visualization**: Various graphs and plots are created to visualize the data, including:
  - Histograms
  - Scatter plots
  - Line graphs
  - Box plots
  - Heatmaps

- **Feature Engineering**: Important features are selected and engineered to improve the performance of the machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Models**: The project implements several machine learning models to achieve its objectives. This includes:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks

- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are also conducted to optimize the models.

- **Predictions and Insights**: Based on the trained models, predictions are made, and insights are drawn to help understand the underlying patterns in the data.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## Installation and Usage

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/[your-repo-name].git
cd [your-repo-name]
```

### Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed. You can create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file.

```bash
jupyter notebook your_notebook.ipynb
```

2. Execute the cells to run the analysis and visualize the data.

### Usage

Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to run the various sections of the project, including data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
